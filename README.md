## Challenge
Write a PHP program that given some text will count the number of buzzwords that appear in it, based on this list of
buzzwords from [Wikipedia Buzzwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_buzzwords) expressed as a percentage of
the total number of words in the text. It is important to know how buzzwordy text is, and your program will be a boon
to readers everywhere. Extra credit if your buzzword meter can take a URL and return the buzzword metric.
